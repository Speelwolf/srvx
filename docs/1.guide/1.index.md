# Getting Started

> Get familiar with srvx usage and why it exists.

srvx provides a unified standard API to create HTTP servers based on the standard web platform primitives ([fetch][fetch], [Request][Request] and [Response][Response]) and works seamlessly with [Deno][Deno], [Bun][Bun], [Node.js][Node.js] and more.

For [Deno][Deno] and [Bun][Bun], srvx unifies interface with zero overhead and for [Node.js][Node.js], creates a lightweight compatibility layer to wrap [node:IncomingMessage][IncomingMessage] as a standard [Request][Request] object and convert final state of [node:ServerResponse][ServerResponse] to a standard [Response][Response] object.

## Quick Start

Create an HTTP server using the `serve` function from `srvx` package.

```js [server.mjs]
import { serve } from "srvx";

const server = serve({
  fetch(request) {
    return new Response("ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!");
  },
});
```

Install `srvx` as a dependency:

:pm-install{name="srvx"}

Then, run the server using your favorite runtime:

::code-group

```bash [node]
node server.mjs
```

```bash [deno]
deno run --allow-env --allow-net server.mjs
```

```bash [bun]
bun run server.mjs
```

::

## Why using srvx?

When you want to create a HTTP server using [Node.js][Node.js], you have to use [node:http](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) module (or a library based on it).

**Example:** Node.js HTTP server ([learn more](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/introduction-to-nodejs)):

```js
import { createServer } from "node:http";

createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end("Hello, Node.js!");
}).listen(3000);
```

Whenever a new request is received, the request event is called with two objects: a request `req` object ([node:IncomingMessage][IncomingMessage]) to access HTTP request details and a response `res` object ([node:ServerResponse][ServerResponse]) that can be used to prepare and send a HTTP response. Popular framework such as [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [Fastify](https://fastify.dev/) are also based on Node.js server API.

Recent JavaScript server runtimes like [Deno][Deno] and [Bun][Bun] have a different way to define a server which is similar to web [fetch][fetch] API.

**Example:** [Deno][Deno] HTTP server ([learn more](https://docs.deno.com/api/deno/~/Deno.serve)):

```js
Deno.serve({ port: 3000 }, (_req, info) => new Response("Hello, Deno!"));
```

**Example:** [Bun][Bun] HTTP server ([learn more](https://bun.sh/docs/api/http)):

```js
Bun.serve({ port: 3000, fetch: (req) => new Response("Hello, Bun!") });
```

As you probably noticed, there is a difference between [Node.js][Node.js] and [Deno][Deno] and [Bun][Bun]. The incoming request is a web [Request][Request] object and server response is a web [Response][Response] object. Accessing headers, request path, and preparing response is completely different between [Node.js][Node.js] and other runtimes.

While [Deno][Deno] and [Bun][Bun] servers are both based on web standards, There are differences between them. The way to provide options, server lifecycle, access to request info such as client IP which is not part of [Request][Request] standard are some examples.

Main use-case of this library is for tools and frameworks that want to be runtime agnostic. By using srvx as standard server layer, instead of depending on of the individual runtime APIs, we push JavaScript ecosystem to be more consistent and moving towards web standards!

### How is it Different?

You might ask, what is the difference between srvx and other HTTP frameworks.

Srvx provides a simple, low-level, and universal API, very similar to [Deno][Deno] and [Bun][Bun]. It has **no conventions**, utilities, or router, and in most cases, using srvx introduces no overhead.

The core of srvx was extracted from the [h3](https://h3.dev/) v2 early development branch and opened to a broader ecosystem to encourage the adoption of Web platform standards without enforcing it's own conventions.
